# L5R-Dragruler
This module is a conversion of the Foundry VTT Drag Ruler module for Legend of the 5 Rings. This shows what range band you are currently moving to from your current start point. The grids are also color-coded. 

This works for gridless and hexagonal maps as well. I hope to eventually implement terrain types, "Difficult squares" and diagonal movement.
